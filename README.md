Object-Oriented Programming Assignments
Welcome to my OOP assignment repository. This space includes two Python scripts developed as part of my coursework on core Object-Oriented Programming principles. These assignments illustrate encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism through practical examples.
Assignment 1: Superhero Class: Encapsulation & Inheritance
File: 1_superhero_class.py
This script introduces a Superhero base class with encapsulated attributes and an extended subclass FlyingHero demonstrating inheritance and method overriding. I used this exercise to model simple character behaviour while applying private attributes and class hierarchies.
Highlights:
Encapsulated attributes using naming conventions
display_stats() method for object introspection
Subclass FlyingHero with an additional fly() method

Assignment 2: Polymorphism Demonstration: Movers
File: 2_polymorphism_movers.py
The second assignment explores polymorphism through a base class Mover and various subclasses (Car, Horse, Plane). Each subclass implements its own version of the move() method, showing how a single interface can support multiple behaviours.
Highlights:
Shared move() interface across classes
Independent implementations to reflect contextual movement
Runtime polymorphism through class invocation
